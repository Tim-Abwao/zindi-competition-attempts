# Marine Invertebrates Classification Challenge

>Teams are challenged to develop an automated image classification solution for photographs of marine invertebrates taken by researchers in South Africa. This will substantially reduce manual image processing efforts, and allow faster detection of changes in patterns of marine invertebrates, since it will reduce the need for human intervention in sample processing and evaluation.
